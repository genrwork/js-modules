Welcome to **Genrwork's** JavaScript modules monorepo! This is where we collaboratively build, share, and evolve a growing collection of open-source JS/TS packages.

> **GenrWork** is a platform from collaborative creation, where open-source tools, libraries, and ideas come to life.

## Overview

This monorepo contains a curated set of JavaScript and TypeScript packages designed to be modular, reusable, and open for contributions. These packages span utilities, components, APIs, and tooling relevant to modern JS development.
